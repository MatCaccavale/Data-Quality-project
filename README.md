# Data-Quality-project
This is the project I did at the end of the Data and Information Quality course in my MSc. It is about the use of different data preparation techniques to deal with a dataset with completely random missing values. In addition, two different ML algorithms for classification are used in order to compare the quality of the reconstructed datasets and how the different techniques affect the learning. Read the file name Report.pdf for all the details.
